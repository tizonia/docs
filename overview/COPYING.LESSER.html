Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>
<p>This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the
terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License,
supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="0">
<li><p>Additional Definitions.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>As used herein, “this License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the “GNU GPL” refers to version 3 of the GNU
General Public License.</p>
<p>“The Library” refers to a covered work governed by this License, other
than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.</p>
<p>An “Application” is any work that makes use of an interface provided by
the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a
subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an
interface provided by the Library.</p>
<p>A “Combined Work” is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with
which the Combined Work was made is also called the “Linked Version”.</p>
<p>The “Minimal Corresponding Source” for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.</p>
<p>The “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li><p>Conveying Modified Versions.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
version:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever
part of its purpose remains meaningful, or</p></li>
<li><p>under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this
License applicable to that copy.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>&lt;!– –&gt;</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="3">
<li><p>Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a
header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code
under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material
is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and
accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer
lines in length), you do both of the following:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered
by this License.</p></li>
<li><p>Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this
license document.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>&lt;!– –&gt;</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="4">
<li><p>Combined Works.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken
together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of
the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for
debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered
by this License.</p></li>
<li><p>Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this
license document.</p></li>
<li><p>For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these
notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of
the GNU GPL and this license document.</p></li>
<li><p>Do one of the following:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="0">
<li><p>Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine
or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked
Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner
specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
Corresponding Source.</p></li>
<li><p>Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a
copy of the Library already present on the user’s computer
system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of
the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
Version.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be
required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL,
and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install
and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by
recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of
the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation
Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and
Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must
provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by
section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>&lt;!– –&gt;</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="5">
<li><p>Combined Libraries.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library
side by side in a single library together with other library facilities
that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and
convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do
both of the following:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on
the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed
under the terms of this License.</p></li>
<li><p>Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a
work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>&lt;!– –&gt;</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="6">
<li><p>Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>
<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as
you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU
Lesser General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you
have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that
published version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version
number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any
version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the
Free Software Foundation.</p>
<p>If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of any version is
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.</p>
<p>&lt;/pre&gt;</p>
