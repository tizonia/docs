macOS
=====

There is no native support for Tizonia on **macOS** `yet`. For more information and
status, see the active discussion in the Tizonia bug tracker:

- `tizonia/tizonia-openmax-il/#316
  <https://github.com/tizonia/tizonia-openmax-il/issues/316>`_.

However, Tizonia is also packaged as a Docker image, and this can be used to
run Tizonia on macOS:
