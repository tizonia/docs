> NOTE: Elementary OS, Linux Mint, Kali Linux are supported on releases based on Ubuntu 'Xenial' or 'Bionic' and Debian 'Buster'.

Please note that the **recommended** way to install Tizonia on a
Debian-compatible system is by running the following command:

```bash

    $ curl -kL https://github.com/tizonia/tizonia-openmax-il/raw/master/tools/install.sh | bash

    # Or its shortened version:

    $ curl -kL https://goo.gl/Vu8qGR | bash

```
> NOTE: This script installs the [latest](https://github.com/tizonia/tizonia-openmax-il/releases/latest)
> release and all the dependencies.

> NOTE: The usual disclaimers apply: trust no-one. You should have a look at
> the installation script before running it on your system!.

## Arch User Repository (AUR)

- [tizonia-all (for the latest released version)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/tizonia-all/)
- [tizonia-all-git (HEAD of master branch)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/tizonia-all-git/)

```bash

    # Please note that if you are upgrading your existing
    # Tizonia installation, you *need* to uninstall it before installing a new version.
    # See GitHub issue https://github.com/tizonia/tizonia-openmax-il/issues/485

    # For the latest stable release
    $ git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/tizonia-all.git
    $ cd tizonia-all
    $ makepkg -si

    # or for the bleeding edge
    $ git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/tizonia-all-git.git
    $ cd tizonia-all
    $ makepkg -si

```

## Snap Package

A 'snap' package is now available to download from the 'Global' snap store
('stable' channel). For more details visit:

- Tizonia's landing page on [Snapcraft.io](https://snapcraft.io/tizonia)
or
- Tizonia on [uApp Explorer](https://uappexplorer.com/snap/ubuntu/tizonia)

To install, first visit [Install
Snapd](https://docs.snapcraft.io/core/install?_ga=2.41936226.1106178805.1514500852-128158267.1514500852)
and make sure that your Linux distro is supported. Follow the instructions
to get the 'snapd' service running on your system, and finally use this command
to install Tizonia:

```bash

$ sudo snap install tizonia

```

Tizonia's snapcraft.yaml file is hosted in its own repository:

- [tizonia-snap](https://github.com/tizonia/tizonia-snap/)

## Docker Image

Tizonia can also be run from a Docker container. A Docker image is available from the Docker hub:

- [docker-tizonia](https://hub.docker.com/r/tizonia/docker-tizonia/)

## Configuration

To use *Spotify*, *Google Play Music*, *SoundCloud*, *Dirble* and *Plex* introduce
your credentials in Tizonia's config file (see instructions inside this file for
more information):

```bash
    ( On first use, Tizonia outputs its configuration file, if it is not there yet )

    $ tizonia --help

    ( now edit $HOME/.config/tizonia/tizonia.conf )

    ( NOTE: If Tizonia was installed from the 'snap' package, use this path instead )
    ( $HOME/snap/tizonia/current/.config/tizonia/tizonia.conf )


```

## Upgrade (Debian / Ubuntu / Raspbian)

To upgrade, simply re-run the install script. This is the most convienent way
of upgrading the software and all its dependencies.

If you prefer to do it manually, it is a two-step process. Run 'apt-get' as
usual to upgrade the Debian packages, but also make sure the various Python
dependencies are up-to-date, as follows:

```bash

    # Step1: This will update Tizonia's Debian packages
    $ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade

    # Step2: Tizonia's Python dependencies
    # (Note that new versions of some of these Python packages are released frequently,
    # so you should do this frequently, even if there isn't a new Tizonia release)
    $ sudo -H pip install --upgrade gmusicapi soundcloud youtube-dl pafy pycountry titlecase pychromecast plexapi fuzzywuzzy eventlet && sudo -H pip install git+https://github.com/plamere/spotipy.git --upgrade

```
